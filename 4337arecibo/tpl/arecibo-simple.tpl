<h2>Arecibo Moon Discovery - Simple Explanation</h2>


<h3>Who Are We?</h3>

We are Peter Nosworthy and Dave Gault, two amateur astronomers from the Blue Mountains near Sydney Australia. 
We both have our own backyard observatoryies with large telescopes and we observe asteroid occultations.

<h3>What Happened?</h3>

On May 20th, we both watched as an asteroid called Arecibo - a large rock in space - moved in front of a star blocking its light for a few seconds.
The asteroid itself was too dim to see, so we could only see the star. It disappeared for about two seconds as we expected. However, about 3 seconds later the star disappeared again for less than a second.

<h3>What Does it Mean?</h3>
The second disappearance of the star probably means that there is another smaller object close to the asteroid and moving with it - a 'moon' of the asteroid.

<h3>Is it really a discovery?</h3>

We can't be 100% sure that we've discovered a moon until someone else can make a similar observation to confirm ours.
We therefore used online forums to ask other amateur astronmers to observe more occultations by this asteroid to try to confirm our discovery.
<p />
About three weeks after our observations, two other amateur astonomers in California recorded another occultation as the asteroid moved in front of a different star. They both saw the star disappear twice just like we did.
<p />
With four observations on two separate occasions, we can be almost 100% certain that the asteroid Arecibo has a moon.

<h3>What's Next?</h3>
We have officially announced the discovery through the
<a href="http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/index.html" target="_blank">Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams</a>.

Scientific discoveries like this are normally reported by publishing a paper in a scientific journal.
