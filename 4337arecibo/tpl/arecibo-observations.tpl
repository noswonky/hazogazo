<h2>Arecibo Observations</h2>

Below are the results of the observations made on May 19th 2021
by Dave Gault and Peter Nosworthy. These were the first known
detections of the suspected satellite of (4337) Arecibo.

<h4>Limiting Magnitudes</h4>

If the observations were the result of one body occulting two components of a
double star, it would require that one component of the double be brighter than G-band mag. 14.4.
This possibility can be excluded by confirming that the target star dropped
below mag. 14.4 during both occultation events.

<p />

We used dim comparison stars in the field of view to measure the limiting magnitudes of
the recordings.
<p />
The limiting magnitudes were 15.4 (Gault) and 15.5 (Nosworthy).
This confirms that the target star dropped below G-band mag. 14.7 during all four recorded events.
<p />
The asteroid was mag. 17.0, well below the limiting magnitude of both recordings.

<h4>First Confirmation Observations</h4>

On June 9, 2021 two observers in California, Kirk Bender and Richard Nolthenius, observed 
<a href="https://cloud.occultwatcher.net/event/159-4337-250589-646390-U116848">this event</a>
in which (4337) Arecibo occulted a mag. 12 star in Ophiuchus. 
<p />
Both observers detected double occultation events consistent with a satellite of Arecibo.
