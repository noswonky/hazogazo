<h4>Limiting Magnitudes</h4>

If the observations were the result of one body occulting two components of a
double star, it would require that one component of the double be brighter than G-band mag. 14.4.
This possibility can be excluded by confirming that the target star dropped
below mag. 14.4 during both occultation events.

<p />

We used dim comparison stars in the field of view to measure the limiting magnitudes of
the recordings.
<p />
The limiting magnitudes were 15.4 (Gault) and 15.5 (Nosworthy).
This confirms that the target star dropped below G-band mag. 14.7 during all four recorded events.
<p />
The asteroid was mag. 17.0, well below the limiting magnitude of both recordings.
