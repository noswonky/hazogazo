 <h1>Arecibo Overview</h1>


<h4>Initial Observations</h4>

On May 20th, 2021 (May 19 at 17:58 UT) two observer, Peter
Nosworthy
(<a href="http://hazelbrookobservatory.com">Hazelbrook Observatory</a>),
and Dave Gault
(<a href="http://www.kuriwaobservatory.com/">Kuriwa Observatory</a>),
observed an occultation of a mag.
13.6 star by the asteroid (4337) Arecibo.
Both observers are located in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney Australia.

Both reported double occultation events consisting of the
expected occultation followed about three seconds later by a
shorter occultation of the target star.

<h4>Interpretation</h4>

The likely explanation is that Arecibo is a binary object.
However, analysis of the video recordings was undertaken to 
rule out other explanations.
