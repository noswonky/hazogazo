<h2>(4337) Arecibo - Overview of Possible Satellite Detection</h2>


<h3>Detection</h3>

On May 20th, 2021 (May 19 at 17:58 UT) two observers, Peter
Nosworthy
(<a href="http://hazelbrookobservatory.com">Hazelbrook Observatory</a>),
and Dave Gault
(<a href="http://www.kuriwaobservatory.com/">Kuriwa Observatory</a> MPC E28),
observed an occultation of a mag.
13.6 star by the asteroid (4337) Arecibo.
Both are located in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney Australia.
<p />
Both observers reported double occultation events consisting of the
expected occultation followed about three seconds later by a
shorter occultation of the target star.
A possible explanation is that Arecibo is a binary object.

David Gault and Peter Nosworthy report possible detection of a 9-km diameter
satellite of the minor planet (4337) Arecibo, from its occultation of the Mv 13.6
star UCAC4 323-126197 = Gaia EDR3 4064355353554962304 on 2021 May 19.74861 UT.
<p />

The observers (Gault and Nosworthy) had a cross-path separation of 0.7km and along path
separation of 18km. The observations were obtained using 30cm and 28cm reflectors,
Watec 910BD video cameras (which have a response similar to the visual band) and
GPS Video Time Inserters used to time stamp the video stream prior to recording to PC hard drives.
<p />

Both of their light curves show two occultation events, with all transitions
being instantaneous.  The light level during all four occultation events was reduced to zero.
Their observations are summarised as:

<p />

The sky-plane separation of the satellite from the main body at 2021 May
19.74861 UT was 23.8 mas (35 km), in position angle 91 deg.
<p />

The lengths of the main body chords are consistent with the three NEOWISE
measurements of the diameter of this asteroid
(19.686, 17.840 and 17.704 km). A fit of a circle to the two chords for the
satellite indicates a diameter of about 9 km.
However the diameter measurement is poorly constrained, with it being within
the range of 5 to 15 km.
<p />

No other known asteroid or comet was within a radius of 5 arc minutes of
(4337) Arecibo, which was at
 RA 17h 57m 00.08s, Dec -25d 24m 24.7s at the time of the observation.
 <p />

The possibility that the observation could be explained by the occultation
of two components of a double star is
excluded by reason of the complete disappearance of the star during both
occultations. If the star was a double
star, it would require that one component be brighter than mag 14.4. The
limiting magnitude of the two recordings
was 15.4 (Gault) and 15.5 (Nosworthy) determined by comparison with four
nearby comparison stars in the range
of Gaia EDR3 G-band mag 14.90 to 15.47. The asteroid magnitude was 17.0,
well below the limiting magnitude of
the recording. The complete disappearance of the star during all occultation
events indicates the absence of any
stellar component brighter than G-band magnitude 14.7, thereby excluding the
possibility of the star being a double star.
<p />

For a single body to have caused all occultations, it would need to be 48km
long, which is inconsistent with the NEOWISE data.
