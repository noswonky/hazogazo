<h2>Arecibo Moon Discovery - The Plain Language FAQ</h2>


<h4>Who Are We?</h4>

We are Peter Nosworthy and Dave Gault, two amateur astronomers from the Blue Mountains near Sydney Australia. 
We mainly use our telescopes observe asteroid asteroid occultations. This is when an asteroid (a large rock in space)
passes in front of a star and blocks the star's light for a few seconds.
These observations help us to learn about the sizes, shapes and motion of asteroids.

We both have our own backyard observatories with large telescopes.
Dave's observatory is a roll-off-roof type located at Hawkesbury Heights and is called <a href="http://www.kuriwaobservatory.com/" target="_blank">Kuriwa Observatory</a>. It houses a 12-inch telescope. Peter's observatory is a domed type called <a href="/" target="_blank">Hazelbrook Observatory</a> housing an 11-inch telescope.

<h4>What Happened?</h4>


At about 4am on May 20th, we both watched as an asteroid called Arecibo moved in front of a star blocking its light for a few seconds.
The asteroid itself was too dim to see, so we could only see the star. It disappeared for about two seconds as we expected. However, about 3 seconds later the star disappeared again for less than a second.

<h4>What Does it Mean?</h4>
The second disappearance of the star probably means that there is another smaller object close to the asteroid and moving with it. That could only be  a 'moon' of the asteroid.

<hr />

<h4>Is it Really a Discovery?</h4>

We can't be 100% sure that we've discovered a moon until someone else makes similar observations to confirm that our result was real and not caused by something else - for example a bird flying in front of the telescope.
We therefore used online forums to ask other amateur astronomers to observe more occultations by this asteroid to try to confirm our discovery.
<p />
<p />
About three weeks after our observations, two other amateur astonomers in California, Richard Nolthenius and Kirk Bender, recorded another occultation as the asteroid moved in front of a different star. They both saw the star disappear twice just like we did. This confirms that the smaller object is real.
With four observations on two separate occasions, we can now be almost certain that the asteroid Arecibo really does have a moon.
<p />

<hr />

<h4>How big are they?</h4>
The observations made in California gave a good measurement of the sizes of both objects. The size of the asteroid is about 24km and the moon is about 13km across.

<hr />

<h4>How Significant is this Discovery?</h4>
There are currently more than 800,000 known asteroids.
The first asteroid with a moon (sometimes called a binary asteroid), was discovered in 1993 by the Galileo spacecraft. As of 2021 there are over 400 asteroids which are known to be binary.
<p />
This discovery adds to that list, but we believe it is the first asteroid moon discovered and confirmed by amateurs and the first to be discovered and confirmed entirely by the occultation method.

<hr />

<h4>What's Next?</h4>

We have officially announced the discovery through the
<a href="http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/index.html" target="_blank">Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams</a>
(see the <a href="[% ROOT_SCRIPT %]?pg=publications">Publications Page</a>).
<p />
Next we need to submit a paper, describing our methods and conclusions, to a scientific journal for peer review and publication.
A paper is now being prepared for submission to <a href="http://www.minorplanet.info/MPB/">The Minor Planet Bulletin</a>.
<p />
We will also continue to encourage others to observe future occultaions by the asteroid Arecibo so that we can more accurately measure the size, shape and orbit of its moon.
